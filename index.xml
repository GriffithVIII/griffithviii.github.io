      <description>«If I can learn, even a little, I&amp;rsquo;m interested.»
I&amp;rsquo;m Adolfo Loewenthal, also known as «GriffithVIII» on the internet. A self-taught person, my bases are C# and MIPS, languages I learned by experimenting on projects involving reverse engineering.
I never had an academic training, my foray into this world took place with TraduSquare, a non-profit community of fantranslators, where I have collaborated and learned in programming, reverse engineering and graphic editing.</description>
